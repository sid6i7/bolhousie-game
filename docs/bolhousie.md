# **Bolhousie — Core Concept Documentation**

## 1. What is Bolhousie?

**Bolhousie** is a nostalgia-driven social game inspired by **Tambola / Housie**, where:

* **Numbers are replaced with iconic Indian Brands**
* The **caller announces Taglines / Jingles instead of numbers**
* Players match taglines to Brand Names on their tickets
* Traditional Tambola “claims” are reimagined with an advertising twist

In short:

> *Tambola, but instead of “42”, you hear*
> *“Thanda Matlab...”, and someone yells "Coca Cola!"*

## 2. Problem Bolhousie Solves

Traditional Tambola:

* Becomes repetitive after a few rounds
* Is passive for non-callers
* Lacks novelty for younger audiences

Brand Quizzes:

* Require specific business knowledge
* Are exclusionary to casual players
* Don’t scale well for large groups

**Bolhousie sits in between**:

* Zero prep needed for players (everyone knows these ads)
* Highly social and entertaining (instant nostalgia hits)
* Works for mixed-age groups (90s kids vs Gen Z)

## 3. Core Game Philosophy

Bolhousie is built on four pillars:

1.  **Recognition, not recall**
    Players don’t need to remember trivia — they just need to *recognize* the jingle.

2.  **Caller as Performer**
    The caller is encouraged to sing the jingles or mimic the voiceover tones.

3.  **Instant Feedback**
    Every call creates a "Oh I know this!" moment.

4.  **Mass Accessibility**
    Even those who don't watch movies watched TV ads growing up.

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Tickets

* Each ticket contains **Brand Names / Logos** instead of numbers
* Typical ticket size:
    * 12–15 brand entries
* Brands are:
    * Household names
    * Cross-generational
    * Iconic advertising history

Example ticket entries:
* Maggi
* Bajaj
* Nirma
* Cadbury
* Fevicol

---

### 4.2 Tagline Pool

* A centralized set of **iconic taglines & jingles**
* Each tagline maps to **one brand only**
* Taglines are:
    * Short
    * Melodic / Rhythmic
    * Deeply embedded in memory

Example:
* “Washing powder...” → *Nirma*
* “Taste the thunder” → *Thums Up*
* “Desh ki dhadkan” → *Hero Honda*

---

### 4.3 Caller System

* Taglines are selected **randomly**
* Caller reads / performs the tagline
* Optional:
    * Audio cues (actual ad snippets)
    * Visual hints (blurred logos)

The caller **never names the brand directly**.

---

### 4.4 Marking Mechanism

* When a player identifies the brand on their ticket:
    * They mark it
* Marking can be:
    * Tap (digital)
    * Chip / pen (offline mode)

2.  System (or moderator) verifies:
    * Correct tagline → brand mapping
    * All required ticket items marked
3.  Claim is accepted or rejected
4.  Once accepted:
    * Claim is locked
    * Cannot be won again
